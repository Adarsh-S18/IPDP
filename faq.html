            <h2 class="question">1.  Shall I get a job if I attend the program?</h2>
            <span class="faq-t"></span>
          </div>
          <p class="answer">All-time question. We help you get ready for a job and search for a job in a better way. We provide long-term placement support. There is no guaranteed job since hiring depends on how employable you are! We make you more employable to land your dream job!</p>

            <h2 class="question">2. Does an online program really work?
            </h2><span class="faq-t"></span>
          </div>
          <p class="answer">Yes! We prefer a small batch with less than 10 participants; we give everyone personal attention. We insist participants keep the camera on. We host lots of fun activities to boost teamwork. We always stay keen to keep the team spirit high. We keep ourselves available at all times to ensure participants results.</p>

            <h2 class="question">3. Is your google review fake or manipulated?
            </h2><span class="faq-t"></span>
          </div>
          <p class="answer">No! 100%; it is given by our program participants and clients only. If you are not convinced, you can search their LinkedIn or social media profiles or directly ask them! We are pretty sure you will get only good responses!

            <h2 class="question">4. Can I get pre-recorded classes?
            </h2><span class="faq-t"></span>
          </div>
          <p class="answer">There is no scope for it. Mostly every day we have group discussion sessions, and pre-recorded videos won't help you! To improve soft skills, you need to interact, be involved, and evolve. For the informative learning sessions, if you could not attend them for a genuine reason, we would organize them again personally for you. We take that additional effort because one-on-one personalized interactions will yield a higher-quality result.

            </h2><span class="faq-t"></span>
          </div>
          <p class="answer">Never! The only thing you should have is a good network facility and 1 to 1.15 hours every weekday for 5 weeks (program duration). There will be some work to be done from your end, which may take an average of 15 minutes in some days. You will enjoy the process, and you will learn to manage your time better!

              </h2><span class="faq-t"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">Our program is simple, goal-oriented, and an experiential learning program. This allows learners to deepen their understanding of the content subject matter and cultivate skills that can be applied in various practice environments or employment settings. Participants feel empowered to use their knowledge and skills in contexts that will aid in their career development. We keep everything simple and sensible, and we also offer individual attention to our participants.

              </h2><span class="faq-t"></span>
            </div>
            <p class="answer">Perhaps at first glance, but let us explain. Let's consider some course takeaways. At the end of the program, you will have a professional resume, cover letter, two professional mock interviews, and a well-created LinkedIn profile. All of this is worth more than the course fee, and your takeaways are worth even more!! Now what say?
